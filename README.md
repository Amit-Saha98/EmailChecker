# EmailChecker

Email validation in JavaScript is an important part of the user experience of a web application. Validation assists in inputting forms and makes sure that only valid information is passed to the server from the client-side of the application.

### Validate email using JavaScript
Email validation is a critical part of validating an HTML form. An email is a string or a subset of ASCII characters separated into two parts by @ symbol. The first part contains personal information while the other contains the domain name at which the email is registered.

The personal information part can contain the following ASCII characters:

* Uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z and a-z)
* Numeric characters (0-9)
* Special characters - ! # $ % & ' * + - / = ? ^
